The Snowflake Data Marketplace is quickly becoming one of my favourite things about working at Snowflake. With the marketplace I have live, instant access to some of the worlds best datasets to give my data deeper context and meaning. Getting and querying data from the Snowflake Data Marketplace is dead simple and built on a very powerful premise. After 3 clicks of the mouse, I have data that is ready for analysis and always in sync with the providers latest updates without movement or an API call.
